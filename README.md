  Uploading files to file system:
Uploading files to file system
ESP8266FS is a tool which integrates into the Arduino IDE. It adds a menu item to Tools menu for uploading the contents of sketch data directory into ESP8266 flash file system.

Download the tool: https://github.com/esp8266/arduino-esp8266fs-plugin/releases/download/0.3.0/ESP8266FS-0.3.0.zip.
In your Arduino sketchbook directory, create tools directory if it doesnâ€™t exist yet
Unpack the tool into tools directory (the path will look like <home_dir>/Arduino/tools/ESP8266FS/tool/esp8266fs.jar)
Restart Arduino IDE
Open a sketch (or create a new one and save it)
Go to sketch directory (choose Sketch > Show Sketch Folder)
Create a directory named data and any files you want in the file system there
Make sure you have selected a board, port, and closed Serial Monitor
Select Tools > ESP8266 Sketch Data Upload. This should start uploading the files into ESP8266 flash file system. When done, IDE status bar will display SPIFFS Image Uploaded message.


If you have the Windows 10 app: 
 - Close the Arduino IDE (v1.8.5)
 - Unzip the ESP8266FS-0.3.0.zip file. 
 - Then copy the newly created ESP8266FS folder into:

 C:\Users\#UserName#\Documents\Arduino\tools\

 - Create the tools folder inside of the ...\Documents\Arduino\ folder if it is not already there.
 - The full location of the .jar file is:
 
 C:\Users\#UserName#\Documents\Arduino\tools\ESP8266FS\tool\esp8266fs.jar

- Start the Arduino IDE
- You should now see the "ESP Sketch Data Upload" option in the Tools menu
